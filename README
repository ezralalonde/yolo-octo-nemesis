A program that repeatedbly reads a positive integer and determines whether it
is "deficient", "perfect", or "abundant".

Abundance, etc. of positive integer `N` is determined according to the
following scheme, where `X` is the sum of its proper divisors.

    - `X` > `N` means N is "abundant".
    - `X` < `N` means N is "deficient".
    - `X` = `N` means N is "perfect".

Input is read from `stdin`, according to the following scheme:

    - The first line of input is the number of lines to read, `L`.
    - The next `L` lines contain the numbers to determine abundance, etc. of.

Output is written to `stdout`, according to the following scheme:

    - For each line of output, two lines of output will be produced.
    - The first line will say the number read, and whether is is abundant, etc.
    - The second line will be blank.
